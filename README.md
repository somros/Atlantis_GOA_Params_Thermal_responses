# Thermal responses in Atlantis GOA

This code deals with the effects of temperature on Atlantis GOA biology.  

Atlantis has two ways to capture thermal effects ([Audzijonyte et al. 2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13272)):  
1. Thermal tolerance niches that restrict spatial distributions.
2. Bioenergetic responses of metabolic processes.  

The code produces thermal tolerance niches from high-level synopses of occurrence as a function of an environmental envelope, distributed from [AquaMaps](https://www.aquamaps.org/). The code also explores the application of humped metabolic responses to increased temperature, after Wisconsin-like models like those applied in [Adams et al. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783622000807) and literature cited therein.
